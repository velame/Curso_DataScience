Release Notes - metar-1.5.0
---------------------------

Python-metar v1.5 includes updated documentation and a few minor bug fixes.
The old sourceforge site is no longer being updated, and so the only authoritative
source repository is the GitHub repo.  To clone the project from there, use

    git clone https://github.com/tomp/python-metar.git

The best way to submit bug reports is through GitHub. You can reach me directly at either
pollard@alum.mit.edu or pollard.tom@gmail.com

Release Notes - metar-1.4.0
---------------------------
Python-metar v1.4 incorporates a handful of bug fixes and enhancements
made over the last couple of years.  Notably, Toby White contributed code to 
let the parser recognize and ignore trend forecasts and runway-state groups.

Starting with this release, new releases will be made available through my 
sourceforge project, at http://python-metar.sourceforge.net/.  I've also 
converted my code repository from CVS to Git, and made public copies of the 
Git repository available on Sourceforge and on Github. To clone the 
repository, you can use either

    git clone git://python-metar.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/python-metar
or
    git clone git://github.com/tomp/python-metar.git

The best way to submit bug reports or request assistance is still
to e-mail me at pollard@alum.mit.edu.
